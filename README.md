# ETL-Project-Largest-Banks-by-Market-Capitalization
This project implements an ETL pipeline in Python to extract, transform, and load data about the worldâ€™s largest banks by market capitalization.  The data is extracted from an archived Wikipedia page, transformed by applying exchange rates, and then stored both in a CSV file and a SQLite database.
